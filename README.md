# RESTful-Services-demo
A simple data manipulation using REST and Node.js

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate that I can use Node.js for more than just webpack and NPM.  I built a small set of RESTful api services around a JSON data set of school info that is publically available.  I am slowly expanding this project and future features I intend to implement include form validation for the Add School service and the Edit School service as well as some cosmetic tweaks so it doesn't look so boilerplate.  I might also add some kind of data managment framework so that I can easily alphbetize and sort the displayed JSON data.

For an example of active search using React and this same data set, see my other repos.
